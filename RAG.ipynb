The program shall also be proliferated using the DigiSkills.pk platform for maximum inclusivity \\nnationwide. Furthermore, a special quota for marginalized women and PWDs shall be ensured in \\neach cohort.  \\nIV.

This is the case with Persons with Disabilities (PWDs). \\nWith high-speed broadband access nationwide and sufficient learning avenues, the cultural and religious \\nbarriers can easily be mitigated without complaints. \\nOwing to the preferential approach of the Government of Pakistan in Digital Pakistan 's drive towards a \\ndigital economy, the following interventions are necessary for the marginalized sections of society. \\nI. As part of the  National High -Impact Skill Development Program, the CoE -AI shall organize an \\noffshoot of the same , aiming to engage marginalized women and PWDs through special \\ncoursework and means of imparting education. \\nII. The program shall be executed through institutions such as Bait-ul-Maal, Ehsaas Program , and \\nother institutions with access to marginalized sections of women and PWDs. \\nIII. The program shall also be proliferated using the DigiSkills.pk platform for maximum inclusivity \\nnationwide. Furthermore, a special quota for marginalized women and PWDs shall be ensured in \\neach cohort.  \\nIV. CoE-AI shall closely monitor and evaluate the program against set targets via periodic studies for \\nimpact assessment and make necessary provisions to ensure all access to all sustainably. \\n4.3 3rd Pillar: Building Progressive & Trusted Environment \\n4.3.1 Regulating to Accelerate Socio-Economic Adoption \\nHuman rights, data privacy, values , and responsible use of AI -based technologies is the trending issue \\nworldwide. International governments are seriously addressing these issues through legal and regulatory \\ninstruments, devising frameworks accordingly. Such legal and regulatory frameworks are needed to ensure \\nsafe and secure data-sharing mechanisms formulated considering best international practices.  \\nI.

These areas can socio-\\neconomically benefit the most from AI adoption and progress by engraining AI technology in its operations. \\nThe stakeholders in Pakistan are those areas of society with significant potential for AI adoption and where \\nthis technology can lead to substantial progress. The classification of sectors has been done based on the \\nfollowing criteria, as shown in the figure below. \\n \\nFigure 1: Criteria for the identification of sectors in society in relevance to AI adoption \\nThe criteria have led to the identification of the following societal areas: \\n1. Agriculture: AI can revolutionize the agricultural sector by introducing process automation, enhanced \\ntraceability, and analyzing large volumes of data available through satellites and weather predictions. \\nBy 2026, agriculture-based AI technology is expected to reach the $2.5 billion mark. Agriculture has a \\nGDP contribution of 20% in Pakistan, a significant portion of our revenue.

Manufacturing: AI and allied technologies such as robotics can revolutionize the manufacturing \\nindustry through automation and enhanced efficiency of operations and safety at workplaces such as \\nfactories. Pakistan can vastly benefit from AI while developing consumer goods specific to the local \\nmarket requirements.  \\n4. Retail & Commerce:  The retail and commerce indu stry is reaping the fruits of using AI and allied \\ntechnologies with expected AI -based value addition by 2035, touching a whopping figure of $2.23 \\ntrillion.

Hence, data is the underlying artefact for putting skilled human capital to work and \\nmaking them experiment with using AI-based models in a controlled yet agile environment.   \\nIII.
